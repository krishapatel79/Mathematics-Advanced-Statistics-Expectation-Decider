# 📊 Expectation Decider – Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Expectation Decider** project analyzes student performance data to predict whether a student will pass a competitive exam using probability and statistical techniques in Python.

This project is created as part of an educational data analysis assignment.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze student study behavior and performance
- Apply probability concepts on real-world data
- Calculate empirical, theoretical, joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities
- Apply Bayes’ Theorem for decision making

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 200 student records with the following columns:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| study_hours | Weekly study hours |
| attendance | Attendance percentage |
| group_discussion | Participation in group discussion (Yes/No) |
| previous_test_score | Previous test score out of 100 |
| final_exam_pass | Final exam result (Pass/Fail) |
